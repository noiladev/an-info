                <p>  JavaScript is a client-side programming language used to create dynamic interactions in app, game and web development. Commonly represented as JS, this language is considered one of the core technologies of the web in conjunction with HTML and CSS. Developers use JavaScript to bring a webpage to life, as it transforms an otherwise static page into one that responds to user engagement, livens up the page with motion, and displays real-time, variable, and personalized content <a href="https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/definition/javascript?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=13708482660^124757113432&experiment_id=^^530755701281^^_DSA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvL-oBhCxARIsAHkOiu0pSeY7LRtraCZ8gNXbmdaSQu2F02gWQw5kmRTMyLsVTEyZ_aVNFm4aAp_wEALw_wcB"  target="_blank">more...</a></p>

                <p>  The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=HTML%20provides%20a%20means%20to,introduce%20content%20into%20the%20page."  target="_blank">more...</a></p>

                <p>  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"  target="_blank"> more...</a></p>
